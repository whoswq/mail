hello Sayaka Ohora！

It has been 3 years since I sent the last e-mail to you. Maybe you have forgotten who I am. Perhaps, this e-mail will make you feel strange.

Three yeas ago I visited your school and we talked a lot about our life. You were a first grade high school student at that time and I guess you are a college student now. Do you like your college life? Is there anything different from your high school?

My college life is full of homework. My major is chemistry and I also need to learn a lot of physics. The courses are really difficult for me and I have to spend a lot of time on it. As a reault, I do not have enough time to do what I like. I am a junior student (that means I have studied in college for 3 years) and I will graduate in next year. Maybe I will go on studying in PKU after graduating. Time flies really fast.

I am not sure if you can see this e-mail. But I am looking forward to your reply!

PS. I have a new e-mail address: [whoswq@pku.edu.cn](mailto:whoswq@pku.edu.cn)

Oh sorry I just sent you an e-mail without finishing writing it! stupid mistake! Anyway, what i wanted to say was thank you for reminding me although i haven't replied to you(I suppose something went wrong on the internet and I couldn't see your e-mail) i remember you clearly!

 Now, as you said in your e-mail, I am in university now and studying economics. Actually, I don't usually go to the university but just take the lessons on the internet because of covid 19. However, I have plenty of time, so I'm reading many books. I want to know more and more things. And also, i've started to study Chinese last month! Now, i'm far from speaking it fluently but i'll study it hard. I wish i can talk with you in Chinese someday!

 And you! you have such a busy life! i want to know about what you're studying now. I haven't studied physics or chemistry in detail but i'm so interested in it. And thinking of studying in PKU is also awesome! i wish you will realize your dream!

P.S.

i will always answer your e-mail, so if you didn't get a reply from me (like for a month) please try to send me the e-mail in another way. sorry for the last time.
